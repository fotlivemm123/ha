  "body":"There was a beautiful town. The town was led by a friendly and generous man, who is the richest person in the town. He was so generous that he always helped people and fulfilled their needs. and did not have a child for so many years. In order to celebrate the birth of his child, he arranged for a massive feast to all the people in the town. He appointed famous cooks from various parts of the country and ordered them to serve more than 100 varieties of foods to the villagers. The cooks and their assistants started cooking the feast. While they managed to have majority of foods, they weren't able to get fish, a special delicacy. The rich man, on knowing this, announced to the people that he would reward enormously to the person who brings him the fish to complete the feast. The announcement was made all over the town and many villagers tried hard to get fish. While most of them failed, a middle aged man got a huge fish and rushed to the rich man. While he was about to enter into his palace, he was stopped by the gate-keeper. The middle aged man promise to give half the reward he earn if the gatekeeper allow let him inside.

  "title":"The Proud Boy",
    "body":"The Proud Boy THERE was once a very proud boy. He always walked through the village with pockets. The boys used to stare at him, his eyes turned down and his hands in his 9 and say nothing; and when he was out of sight, they breathed freely. So the proud boy was lonely, and would have had no friends out of doors if it had not been for two stray dogs, the green trees, and a flock of geese upon the common. One day, just by the weaver's cottage, he met the tailor's son. Now the tailor's son made more noise than any other boy in the village, and when he had done anything wrong he stuck to it, and said he didn't care; so the neighbours thought that he was very brave, and would do wonders when he came to be a man, and some of them hoped he would be a great traveller,and stay long in distant lands. When the tailor's son saw the proud boy he danced in front of him, and made faces, and provoked him sorely, until, at last, the proud boy turned round and suddenly boxed the ears of the tailor's son, and threw his hat into the road. The tailor's son was surprised, and, without waiting to pick up his hat, ran away, and sitting down in the carpenter's yard, cried bitterly. After a few minutes, the proud boy came to him and returned him his hat, saying politely. There is no dust on it ; you deserved to have your ears boxed, but I am sorry I was so rude as to throw your hat on to the road.I thought you were proud, said the tailor's son, astonished; I didn't think you'd say that I wouldn't. Perhaps you are not proud? No, I am not. Ah, that makes a difference,said the proud boy, still more politely. When you are proud, and have done a foolish thing, you make a point of owning it.But it takes a lot of courage, said the tailor's son. Oh, dear, no, answered the proud boy;it only takes a lot of cowardice not to; and then turning his eyes down again, he softly walked away."

  "title":"The Broken Horse",
    "body":"Tina was a 6 years old cute girl. She is very fond of wooden toys, especially she had a beautiful wood horse gifted by her uncle when she was 2 years old. The wooden horse has been her close pal and her pet. e She has a 9 years old brother. She went on a vacation to a nature resort in the woods with her family. She carried the wooden horse with her. She enjoyed her holiday with her family in the woods. While she was packing things with her brother as they planned to return home, the wooden horse fallen down and one of the legs were broken. Tina was too sad and silently cried for her horse. She was very upset. They packed all things and left the woods. Entire family tried to cheer up the sweet little girl, but Tina was so silent, very upset. Tina's brother tried to console her a lot. They had a break for lunch and Tina refused to eat. Her momma requested her to eat food, she ate a very little amount of food. While others were eating, she sat quietly in their car. Her brother came to her and kissed her cheek, told her, Tina dear, don't worry, don't get upset dear. It is only a wooden toy. The horse doesn't have a life like us and it is just a lifeless thing. Don't be so sad for the broken leg.Even if the horse loses its tail, it won't be hurting the horse. Even if all four legs are broken, the wooden horse remains same.Even if the horse loses its head, it won't be painful. I will buy a new wood horse for you! Tina replied, 'You think it doesn't matter that a leg of my pet toy was broken?' Her brother replied, 'Yes dear!' Tina replied, 'Yes brother you are right. It won't be a major issue for you even if the horse is broken into pieces at this age. But if you are in my age, if you had a pet like I had, you will feel how painful it would be to even if a small part of horse is broken!' Her brother left silently! Just like Tina, everyone has different feelings of different aspects. What we considered of no importance will be a treasure of somebody!"

  "title":"In the Moonlight",
    "body":"HE picked a buttercup, and held it up to her chin. Do you like butter? he asked. Butter! she exclaimed. They are not made into butter. They are made into crowns for the Queen; she has a new one every morning.I'll make you a crown, he said. You shall wear it to-night. But where will my throne be ? she asked. It shall be on the middle step of the stile by the corn-field. So when the moon rose I went out to see. He wore a red jacket and his cap with the feather in it. Round her head there was a wreath of buttercups; it was not much like a crown. On one side of the wreath there were some daisies, and on the other was a little bunch of blackberryblossom. Come and dance in the moonlight, he said ; so she climbed up and over the stile,and stood in the corn-field holding out her two hands to him. He took them in his, and then they danced round and round all down the pathway, while the wheat nodded wisely on either side, and the poppies awoke and wondered. On they went, on and on through the corn-field towards the broad green meadows stretching far into the distance. On and on, he shouting for joy, and she laughing out so merrily that the sound travelled to the edge of the wood, and the thrushes heard, and dreamed of Spring. On they went, on and on, and round and round, he in his red jacket, and she with the wild flowers dropping one by one from her wreath. On and on in the moonlight, on and on till they had danced all down the corn-field, till they had crossed the green meadows, till they were hidden in the mist beyond. That is all I know; but I think that in the far far off somewhere, where the moon is shining, he and she still dance along a corn-field, he in his red jacket, and she with the wild flowers dropping from her hair.

  "title":"Writing a Book",
    "body":"LET us write a book, they said; but what shall it be about ?A fairy story, said the elder sister. A book about kings and queens, said the other. Oh, no, said the brother, let's write about animals. We will write about them all, they cried together. So they put the paper, and pens, and ink ready. The elder sister took up a fairy story and looked at it, and put it down again. I have never known any fairies, she said,except in books; but, of course, it would not do to put one book inside another anyone could do that.I shall not begin to-day, the little one said, for I must know a few kings and queens before I write about them, or I may say something foolish. I shall write about the pig, and the pony, and the white rabbit, said the brother; but first I must think a bit. It would never do to write a book without thinking. Then the elder sister took up the fairy story again, to see how many things were left out, for those, she thought, would do to go into her book. The little one said to herself, Really, it is no good thinking about kings and queens until I have known some, so I must wait; and while the brother was considering about the pig, and the pony, and the white rabbit he fell asleep. So the book is not written yet, but when it is we shall know a great deal."

  "title":"The Donkey on Wheels",
    "body":"THERE was once a poor little donkey on wheels. It had never wagged its tail, or tossed its head, or said, Hee-haw! or tasted a tender thistle. It always went about, anywhere that anyone pulled it, on four wooden wheels, carrying a foolish knight, who wore a large cocked hat and a long cloak, because he had no legs. Now, ao man who has no legs, and rides a donkey on wheels, has little cause for pride; but the knight was haughty, and seldom remembered his circumstances. So the donkey suffered sorely, and in many ways. One day the donkey and the knight were on the table in front of the child to whom they both belonged. She was cutting out a little doll's frock with a large pair of scissors. Mistress, said the knight, this donkey tries my temper. Will you give me some spurs?Oh, no, sir knight,the child answered.You would hurt the poor donkey; besides, you have no heels to put them on.Cruel knight! exclaimed the donkey.Make him get off, dear mistress; I will carry him no longer.Let him stay,said the child, gently; he has no legs, and cannot walk.Then why did he want spurs?Just the way of the world, dear donkey, just the way of the world.Ah! sighed the donkey, some ways are very trying, especially the world's; and then it said no more, but thought of the fields it would never see, and the thistles it would never taste."
